    "description": "ZGloom is a re-implementation of Amiga FPS Gloom, including support for Zombie Massacre.\nGloom was a 1995 Doom-clone from Black Magic Software for Commodore Amiga. It had very messy and meaty graphics and needed a very powerful Amiga computer back then. It had several official successors like Gloom Deluxe\/Ultimate Gloom (a graphical enhanced Gloom), Gloom 3 and Zombie Massacre. \nGloom was made freely available by its developers. Also other games with the engine like Gloom 3 or Zombie Massacre can be downloaded for free on Aminet. Otherwise you can take the original game files from your game installation.",
